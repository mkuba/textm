Bank of England: no early interest rate rise as wages forecast slashed
Mark Carney says rate rises will be 'slow and small' as Bank downgrades wage forecasts after data show UK pay levels have fallen for the first time in five years
The Bank of England's interest rates are set to stay at their historic lows until next year, after the central bank signalled that it does not expect to see strong growth in earnings. 

As data released showed that average earnings have fallen for the first time in five years, the Bank made large downward revisions to its forecasts.
Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said earnings growth had been "remarkably weak, even as unemployment has fallen rapidly".

Its forecast for annual earnings growth in the last quarter of this year has been halved from from 2.5pc to 1.25pc. 

The Bank said that it would now place more weight on wages in its assessment of "spare capacity" in the labour market, suggesting that interest rate hikes may be some way off.
Sterling fell to a two-month low against the US dollar on the news, falling when labour market figures were announced at 9.30am and as the Bank press conference began.
Analysts had expected to see the Bank cut wage growth forecasts, since official data have far underperformed estimates since the Bank's last quarterly update.
Jeremy Cook, of currency firm World First, said that while spare capacity had been reduced, the focus on wages meant that those who expected a rate hike at the end of this year "are getting smacked hard".
On Wednesday the Bank revised down its estimate of spare capacity in the economy from 1-1.5pc to 1pc.
The weakness in wage growth "is also consistent with there having been higher labour supply ... than previously thought" said the Bank.
Mr Carney said that there is "no magic number" for earnings growth that interest rate setters are looking for.
When the Bank does start increasing its interest rates, it will do so in a "small, slow" manner, said Mr Carney.
The dovish message from the central bank also helped the FTSE 100 rise 0.4pc to 6660. Housebuilder shares were similarly buoyed, with Barratt Developments rising 2pc and Redrow gaining 3.1pc.
Moving away from the market, the Bank upwardly revised its 2014 growth forecast from 3.4pc to 3.5pc.
"Sustained economic momentum is looking more assured", Mr Carney said on Wednesday. "The economy is returning to a semblance of normality."
That is an estimate much more bullish than analyst consensus, which suggests that the UK will only grow by 3pc this year. Growth in 2015 is also expected to be higher, at 3pc, compared with an estimate of 2.9pc in May.
Rapid falls in unemployment have also seen the Bank lower its estimate of the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment to 5.5pc from 6.5pc.
