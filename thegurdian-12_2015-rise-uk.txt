Weak eurozone inflation boosts stimulus hopes; Yellen hints at rate hike - as it happened
One last thing..... Bloomberg is reporting that the ECB will revise down its inflation predictions tomorrow.
That’s very plausible, given today’s inflation report was weaker than expected.
She says the economy is on the road to recovery, and that “we’re doing well”. Another signal that she believes higher interest rates are needed?
The Fed chair also says that quantitative easing and forward guidance did work, although there are some things she’d have done differently with hindsight.
The most effective flavour (flavor) was QE3, she adds, as it was ‘open-ended’ (the Fed just kept pumping money into the economy until things improved).
